This utility allows you to work with factory snapshots, carry out OS factory
image updates for Sailfish OS and make and restore snapshots of your live
system easily by wrapping the btrfs snapshot utilities and carrying out all
actions required to activate a btrfs snapshot.

For advanced users, it also allows to easily enter a chroot of a given snapshot
to carry out maintenance tasks. The utility can work from a live system as
well as from the recovery partition.

Be careful, this utility works on the underlying btrfs subvolume zero, which
means that wrong use of the utility can lead to bricking your device to a
point where the factory image isn't available anymore, so factory reset does
not work. It is recommended that you make a copy of your factory image.
